# Form Builder Assignment

Create a React form component in Next.js that displays submitted data on the same page.

## Requirements

### Form Fields

- Name
- Age
- Email
- Phone Number

### Validation Rules

Each field must support:

- Required/optional validation
- Type validation (Number, String, Email)
- Min/max length constraints
- Display validation errors in red below the field

### UI Components

- Submit button
- Reset button
- Display submitted data beside the form after successful submission
- Show validation errors at the bottom of each field

### Technical Stack

- Next.js 16
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (optional)
- shadcn/ui components (optional)

### Code Quality

- Readable, self-documenting code
- DRY principles (avoid unnecessary repetition)
- Well-structured components
- **No third-party form libraries** (e.g., react-hook-form, formik)

### Bonus

Implement form data management using:

- Context API, or equivalent

## Guidelines

- Aim for a complete, working implementation that meets all requirements. However, don't spend excessive time perfecting every detail—you'll have the opportunity to refine and improve the solution during the pair programming round.

- Please refrain from using AI tools to generate the entire solution. The subsequent technical round will involve pair programming without AI assistance, and it's important that you're comfortable with the code you've written.

- If anything is unclear or you have questions, please reach out for clarification.
